The key features of the code include:

1.Chat History Display: A scrolled text widget is used to display the chat history. It shows the conversation between the user and the chatbot.

2.User Input Entry: The user can input messages using an entry widget. This is where the user types their messages to interact with the chatbot.

3.Send Button: A "Send" button triggers the sending of the user's input for processing by the chatbot.

4.SpaCy Integration: The code integrates the spaCy library to process the user's input. It identifies verbs from the user's message.

5.Response Generation: The chatbot generates responses based on the verbs identified in the user's input. It tries to use learned responses or defaults to a generic response if no specific learning is available.

6.Learning Mechanism: The chatbot learns from user interactions. It updates its memory with learned responses based on keywords and verbs present in the user's messages.

7.Memory Persistence: The learned responses are saved to a JSON file (chatbot_memory.json). This file is loaded when the chatbot starts, allowing it to retain knowledge from previous interactions.

8.Graphical User Interface: The GUI components (text widgets, entry, and button) are organized using Tkinter to create a simple and interactive chat interface.

9.Error Handling: The code includes basic error handling, such as checking for the existence of the memory file.

10.Object-Oriented Design: The chatbot functionality is encapsulated within a class (ChatbotGUI), promoting modularity and maintainability.

11.Main Application Loop: The Tkinter application enters the main loop (root.mainloop()) to continuously handle user interactions.
